# Climate changes on Leme-SP

Another bunch of charts in order to analyze the evolution of monthly temperature rage in the region of Leme-SP over the course of years.

This analysis can evolve to a web app in the future, so *stay awhile and listen*. De facto this is just a overcomplicated POC.


## The Data

The monthly data is obtained by analysing the [CPTEC][1] Brazil heat maps, using the minimum, maximum and average data for each year and month.

This analysis will initially follow my [Strava][2] JSON based datasets style, but this will change as the data grows.
